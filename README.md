Hii everyone,I'm Jovel M Binoj

#project overview
-----------------
The House Price Prediction Model helps users estimate house price using machine learning models.
=>Data preprocessing to clean and transform the datasset.
=>Perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
=>model training and evaluation based on suitable algorithm.

#Dataset
--------
=>Collecting dataset from Kaggle platform.


=>Dataset include features like location,sqft,bhk.

#Data preprocessing 
-------------------
=>Cleaning the data.
=>Handling missing value.
=>Encoding categorical features.
=>Collecting useful data.
=>Removing outliers.

#Data visualization
---------------
=>Visualizing the data for better understand.

#Model creation
--------------
=>Apply algorithm to perform the model.
=>Using alogrithm such as Lasso,DecisionTreeRegressor.
=>Performing GridsearchCV used to increase model performance.

#Price prediction
----------------
=>Finally the trained model to predict house price for new inputs.
